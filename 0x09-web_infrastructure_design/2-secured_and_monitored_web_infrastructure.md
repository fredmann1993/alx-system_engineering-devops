#Secured and monitored web infrastructure

User accesses www.foobar.com:
When a user wants to access the website, they enter www.foobar.com into their web browser.

DNS Lookup:
The domain name system (DNS) resolves the domain name www.foobar.com to the IP addresses of the servers hosting the website. This is done through a DNS lookup.

Load Balancer:
The user's request is then forwarded to a load balancer which distributes the traffic across the three servers. This ensures that if one server goes down, traffic can still be served by the other servers.

Web Server 1:
The load balancer forwards the request to Web Server 1, which is responsible for processing the user's request and returning the appropriate response. It could be running Apache, Nginx, or any other web server software.

Application Server 1:
If Web Server 1 needs to run any code, such as a database query or an API call, it forwards the request to Application Server 1. The application server is responsible for running the code and returning the result back to Web Server 1.

Database Server 1:
If Application Server 1 needs to access a database, it forwards the request to Database Server 1. The database server is responsible for storing and retrieving data.

SSL/TLS Encryption:
SSL/TLS encryption is used to secure the traffic between the user's web browser and the web server. This prevents anyone from intercepting and reading the data being transmitted. A certificate authority can be used to issue an SSL/TLS certificate for www.foobar.com.

Web Server 2:
If the traffic increases beyond the capacity of Web Server 1, the load balancer forwards the request to Web Server 2, which can serve the request in parallel with Web Server 1.

Application Server 2:
If Web Server 2 needs to run any code, such as a database query or an API call, it forwards the request to Application Server 2. The application server is responsible for running the code and returning the result back to Web Server 2.

Database Server 2:
If Application Server 2 needs to access a database, it forwards the request to Database Server 2. The database server is responsible for storing and retrieving data.

Web Server 3:
If the traffic continues to increase, the load balancer forwards the request to Web Server 3, which can serve the request in parallel with Web Server 1 and Web Server 2.

Application Server 3:
If Web Server 3 needs to run any code, such as a database query or an API call, it forwards the request to Application Server 3. The application server is responsible for running the code and returning the result back to Web Server 3.

Database Server 3:
If Application Server 3 needs to access a database, it forwards the request to Database Server 3. The database server is responsible for storing and retrieving data.

Security Monitoring:
The web infrastructure should be monitored for security vulnerabilities and attacks. This can be done through automated tools such as intrusion detection systems and web application firewalls. Regular security audits should also be performed.
